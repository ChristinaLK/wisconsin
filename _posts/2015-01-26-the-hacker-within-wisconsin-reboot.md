A group of about 20 interested people answered the call to contribute to a
reboot of the founding [Hacker Within][thw] chapter at U. Wisconsin-Madison.
The most important decision that we made was to meet again.  More
specfiically, to meet on Friday, January 30, at 12 noon... and hopefully every
2 weeks there after.

The plan for that first meeting, now scheduled for ME2188, is to provide a
brief overview of the Jekyll markup system for Github pages, facilitating
others being able to contribute in the future.  That subject is now [at risk][email].

We did, however, identify a number of topics for future meetings.

We were able to brainstorm a fairly extensive list of topics.  Two important observations:

1. The list of those committed to giving presentations is severely lacking
   student contributions.  This effort will only succeed if students are
   willing to share their own experiences.  It is not a course: it is a
   community of peers who are learning from each other.
2. The list of topics is NOT closed.  If you have an idea that you are
   interested in - or even better, interested in presenting! - then please
   feel free to add it to the list.

Those with potential presenters
=================================

* "Dangers of dynamic web content" - Michelle Craft
* "Reproducible Linux environment"  - Paul Wilson
* "Stackedit.io" - Jean-Yves Sgro
* "Intro to Latex" - Meghan McGarry
* "Hobby Hacks/Web Server Tricks" - Robert Carlsen

====================================
Topics without identified presenters
=====================================

* Software distribution practices
* Managing multiple python versions
* cloud options
* Different dev environments: Charm, ipython, spyder, etc. - comparison or orientation
* How to sell version control (or software) to collaborators
* SQL
* Keyboard shortcuts
* SSH voodoo (ssh tunnels, etc.)
* "Religious" battles: text editors, presentation SW, version control SW, website creation,
* Using VMs, containers (docker)
* Web page creation (knitr, sphinx)
* Self-marketing (making a personal website)
* GPUs and CUDA
* Julia
* Useful Libraries (esp. for visualization): pandas, matplotlib, ggplot2, open_gl, etc.
* make, cmake, scons
* Licenses: open source
* Strategic search hacks
